# Java Spring Test

The Anywr Java Spring development test is intended to evaluate your problem-solving skills, general knowledge of Java, Spring and application development principles, and overall approach to development. The test will cover a range of topics including theory, practical application, troubleshooting, database design, testing, and critical thinking.

## Resources

Feel free to use any resources you need while completing this test. Whether it's searching Google, GitHub, GitLab, or even ChatGPT, go ahead. This is an "open resource" test, and we understand that real programmers look things up when necessary. We believe that using resources is a good thing, and we don't consider it a weakness. Of course, if you don't need to consult any resources, that's great too. we just ask that you list any resources you consulted in the README file.

## Exercice

The main idea is to focus on authentication and authorization using Java Spring Boot as per the below :

Create a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot that implements a user authentication and authorization system. The API should have the following features:

- Allow users to register by providing a unique username and password.
- Allow users to log in by providing their username and password.
- Allow users to retrieve their own profile information, such as their username and email address. (Optional if you have time)
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate and authorize API requests.

In addition, the API should include the following:

- Input validation to ensure that only valid data is entered into the database.
- Unit tests to ensure that the authentication and authorization system functions correctly. (Optional if you have time)

## Code delivery
- Make sure to use GIT, and to commit your changes following Angular git commit conection https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/
- Push to your account on github
- Once finished, allow developer access for username anywr-group-recruitement
- Update the recruitement team with the link of your project.
